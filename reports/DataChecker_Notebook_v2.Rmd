<!-- Code based on DataChecker_main_v2_20180220.R. -->

This notebook was written for the AWEAR Case Studies as part of a PhD project on *Engineering Systems Design in Healthcare* at the Engineering Systems Division, DTU Management, in collaboration with Rigshospitalet-Glostrup.

The purpose of this notebook is to provide regular reports on the data being recorded from study participants, to check that it is being recorded and
looks as expected. The R script imports, tests and plots data from a specified participant and timeframe, as shown in the code and output below.

```

### Report subject and period:
```{r Settings, echo=FALSE}

# Select user
userid <- users$nina

# Set period of interest
d.start <- as.POSIXct("2018-06-19") # yyyy-mm-dd 
d.stop <- as.POSIXct("2018-07-11")

cat("This report is for user ", names(users[users==userid]), "for the time period from ", as.character(d.start), " to ", as.character(d.stop)) 

```


### Import and restructure data:
Overview of available csv files and their current use status:

File | Description | Status
------------- | ------------- | -------------
"activity.csv" | coded activity types | in use
"battery.csv" | charging log | in use
"bluetooth.csv" | - | not in use
"calllog.csv" | log of phonecalls | not in use
"experience_sampling.csv" | answers to daily self-reports | in use
"hardware_info.csv" | - | not in use
"location.csv" | GPS data from watch and phone | in use
"screen.csv" | screen on/off transitions (phone) | in use
"sms.csv" | sms log | not in use
"step_count.csv" | step counts from watch and phone | in use
"wearable.csv" | - | no longer in use
"wifi.csv"  | - | not in use

The output below confirms which files have been imported, followed by processing steps.


```{r Import, echo=FALSE}
datasets.all <- get.data(folder, not.in.use) %>% 
  lapply(restructure, userid, d.start, d.stop)
datasets.all <- Filter(function(x) !is.null(x)[1],datasets.all) # remove any null dataframes

#test<-filter(datasets.all$activity, user=="f9f24838-c844-42d4-8343-b20ebdd220f3")

# Save dataset
#saveRDS(datasets.all, file = paste0("M:/PhD_Folder/CaseStudies/Data_analysis/Participants_Rdata/",
                                    #names(users[users==userid]),"_",d.start,"_to_",d.stop,".Rds"))

```


### Quality check: data source
Check whether data coming from watch, phone or both (also gives date of last reading). 

```{r QC, echo=FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(datasets.all)){
  j <- datasets.all[[i]]
  if(!is.null(j)){
    cat("Data in ",names(datasets.all)[i],"comes from ", distinct(j,dsource)[,1],"\n");
    cat("Last reading in",names(datasets.all)[i],"is on",capture.output(max(j$timestamp)),"\n\n");
   
    assign(paste0("tally.",names(datasets.all)[i]), j %>% count(dates))
    
    }
}
```

## Visualise data:

<!-- to do -->

<!-- * resolve warnings -->
<!-- * customise colours -->
<!-- * axes with dates: orders not in time, january after feb (ordered by day not taking month into account) -->

```{r Plots, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
results<-show_plots(datasets.all, to_plot)
for(i in 1:length(results)){
  print(results[[i]])
}

# plot_ly(tally.activity,x=~dates,y=~n, type="bar") %>% layout(title="activity")
# plot_ly(tally.battery,x=~dates,y=~n, type="bar") %>% layout(title="battery")
# plot_ly(tally.experience_sampling,x=~dates,y=~n, type="bar") %>% layout(title="ES")
# plot_ly(tally.location,x=~dates,y=~n, type="bar") %>% layout(title="location")
# plot_ly(tally.screen,x=~dates,y=~n, type="bar") %>% layout(title="screen")
# plot_ly(tally.step_count,x=~dates,y=~n, type="bar") %>% layout(title="steps")

```
